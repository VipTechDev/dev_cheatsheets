### 📂 Reading & Writing Files

#### 🔹 File Opening Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `'r'` | Read |
| `'w'` | Write (overwrite) |
| `'a'` | Append |
| `'r+'` | Read and write |
| `'b'` | Binary mode |

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")

with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Log entry: Something happened.")

with open("data.txt", "r+") as file:
    content = file.read()
    file.write("Updated content: " + content)
```

---

#### 📖 File Reading Methods

```python
file.readlines()  # All lines as list
file.readline()   # Next line as string
file.read()       # Entire content as string
```

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    next_line = file.readline()
    content = file.read()
```

---

#### ✍️ File Writing Methods

```python
file.write("Hello\n")         # Write string
file.writelines(["A\n", "B\n"])  # Write list of strings
```

```python
lines = ["Hello\n", "World\n"]
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

---

#### 🔁 Iterating Over Lines

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)
```

---

#### 🔓 open() and close()

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

---

#### ✅ with open()

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

---

### 🐼 Pandas Essentials

#### 🔹 Import Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd
```

---

#### 📥 Read Data

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx")
```

---

#### 💾 Save Data

```python
df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
```

---

#### 🔍 Access Columns

```python
df["age"]
df[["name", "age"]]
```

---

#### 📊 Describe & Info

```python
df.describe()
df.info()
```

---

#### 🧹 Drop Columns/Rows

```python
df.drop(["age", "salary"], axis=1, inplace=True)
df.drop(index=[5, 10], axis=0, inplace=True)
```

---

#### ❌ Drop Missing Values

```python
df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
```

---

#### 🔁 Find Duplicates

```python
duplicate_rows = df[df.duplicated()]
```

---

#### 🔎 Filter Rows

```python
filtered_df = df[(df["age"] > 30) & (df["salary"] < 50000)]
```

---

#### 🧮 Grouping

```python
grouped = df.groupby(["category", "region"]).agg({"sales": "sum"})
```

---

#### 👀 Head & Tail

```python
df.head(5)
df.tail(5)
```

---

#### 🔗 Merge DataFrames

```python
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=["product_id", "category_id"])
```

---

#### 🔄 Replace Values

```python
df["status"].replace("In Progress", "Active", inplace=True)
```

---

#### 🖨️ Print DataFrame

```python
print(df)
df
```

---

### 🔢 NumPy Essentials

#### 🔹 Import NumPy

```python
import numpy as np
```

---

#### 📥 Create Arrays

```python
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```

---

#### 📊 Array Operations

```python
np.mean(array)       # Average
np.sum(array)        # Total
np.min(array)        # Minimum
np.max(array)        # Maximum
np.dot(array1, array2)  # Matrix multiplication
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

- Use `with open()` for safe file handling  
- Pandas simplifies data loading, cleaning, and analysis  
- NumPy powers fast numerical operations and matrix math  
- Combine all three for powerful data workflows

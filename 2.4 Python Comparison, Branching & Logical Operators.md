## 🧠 Python Cheat Sheet: Comparison, Branching & Logical Operators

This cheat sheet covers essential decision-making tools in Python: comparison operators, conditional branching, and logical operators — with real-life examples to help you ritualize the logic.

---

### 🔍 1. Comparison Operators

#### ✅ Equality (`==`)
Checks if two values are equal.
```python
age = 25
if age == 25:
    print("You are 25 years old.")
```

---

#### ❌ Inequality (`!=`)
Checks if two values are not equal.
```python
if age != 30:
    print("You are not 30 years old.")
```

---

#### 🔼 Greater Than / Less Than (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
Compares if one value is greater or smaller than another.
```python
if age >= 20:
    print("Yes, age is greater than or equal to 20.")
```

---

### 🌿 2. Branching (Conditional Logic)

#### 🔹 IF Statement
Make decisions based on conditions.
```python
age = 20
if age >= 21:
    print("You can enter the bar.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you cannot enter.")
```

---

#### 🔸 ELIF Statement
Check multiple conditions in sequence.
```python
if age >= 21:
    print("You can enter the bar.")
elif age >= 18:
    print("You can watch a movie.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you cannot do either.")
```

#### 🏧 Real-Life Example: ATM Decision Flow
```python
user_choice = "Withdraw Cash"
if user_choice == "Withdraw Cash":
    amount = int(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
    if amount % 10 == 0:
        print("Amount dispensed:", amount)
    else:
        print("Please enter a multiple of 10.")
else:
    print("Thank you for using the ATM.")
```

---

### 🔗 3. Logical Operators

#### 🚫 NOT Operator
Negates a condition.
```python
is_do_not_disturb = True
if not is_do_not_disturb:
    send_notification("New message received")
```

---

#### 🔐 AND Operator
All conditions must be true.
```python
has_valid_id_card = True
has_matching_fingerprint = True
if has_valid_id_card and has_matching_fingerprint:
    open_high_security_door()
```

---

#### 🎬 OR Operator
At least one condition must be true.
```python
friend1_likes_comedy = True
friend2_likes_action = False
friend3_likes_drama = False
if friend1_likes_comedy or friend2_likes_action or friend3_likes_drama:
    choose_a_movie()
```

## 🧠 Python Data Structures Part-2  
Dictionaries and Sets — Methods, Syntax, and Examples

---

### 📘 Dictionaries

#### 🧱 Creating a Dictionary  
A dictionary is a built-in data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs.  
```python
dict_name = {}  # Creates an empty dictionary  
person = { "name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York" }
```

---

#### 🔍 Accessing Values  
Access values using their keys.  
```python
name = person["name"]  
age = person["age"]
```

---

#### ➕ Add or Modify  
Insert or update key-value pairs.  
```python
person["Country"] = "USA"      # Adds new entry  
person["city"] = "Chicago"     # Updates existing value
```

---

#### ❌ del  
Removes a key-value pair.  
```python
del person["Country"]
```

---

#### 🔄 update()  
Merges another dictionary into the current one.  
```python
person.update({"Profession": "Doctor"})
```

---

#### 🧹 clear()  
Removes all key-value pairs.  
```python
grades.clear()
```

---

#### 🔑 Key Existence  
Check if a key exists using `in`.  
```python
if "name" in person:  
    print("Name exists in the dictionary.")
```

---

#### 📄 copy()  
Creates a shallow copy of the dictionary.  
```python
new_person = person.copy()  
new_person = dict(person)  # Alternative method
```

---

#### 🗝️ keys()  
Get all keys as a list.  
```python
person_keys = list(person.keys())
```

---

#### 📦 values()  
Get all values as a list.  
```python
person_values = list(person.values())
```

---

#### 🔗 items()  
Get all key-value pairs as a list of tuples.  
```python
info = list(person.items())
```

---

### 🧮 Sets

#### 🧱 Defining Sets  
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.  
```python
empty_set = set()  
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}  
colors = ("orange", "red", "green")  # Tuple for comparison
```

---

#### ➕ add()  
Add an element to a set.  
```python
fruits.add("mango")
```

---

#### 🧹 clear()  
Remove all elements from a set.  
```python
fruits.clear()
```

---

#### 📄 copy()  
Create a shallow copy of a set.  
```python
new_fruits = fruits.copy()
```

---

#### ❌ discard()  
Remove an element if it exists (no error if not).  
```python
fruits.discard("apple")
```

---

#### 🔍 issubset()  
Check if one set is a subset of another.  
```python
is_subset = fruits.issubset(colors)
```

---

#### 🔍 issuperset()  
Check if one set is a superset of another.  
```python
is_superset = colors.issuperset(fruits)
```

---

#### 🧺 pop()  
Remove and return an arbitrary element.  
```python
removed_fruit = fruits.pop()
```

---

#### ❌ remove()  
Remove a specific element (raises error if not found).  
```python
fruits.remove("banana")
```

---

#### 🔀 Set Operations  
Perform union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.  
```python
combined = fruits.union(colors)  
common = fruits.intersection(colors)  
unique_to_fruits = fruits.difference(colors)  
sym_diff = fruits.symmetric_difference(colors)
```

---

#### 🔄 update()  
Add elements from another iterable.  
```python
fruits.update(["kiwi", "grape"])
```

## 📘 Glossary: Python Data Structures  
Welcome! This alphabetized glossary contains many of the terms in this course. This comprehensive glossary also includes additional industry-recognized terms not used in course videos. These terms are important for you to recognize when working in the industry, participating in user groups, and participating in other certificate programs.

| Term               | Definition |
|--------------------|------------|
| Aliasing           | Refers to giving another name to a function or a variable. |
| Ampersand          | A character typically `&` standing for the word "and." |
| Compound elements  | Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. |
| Delimiter          | A character or sequence used to separate or mark boundaries between elements in a data structure. |
| Dictionaries       | A data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. |
| Function           | A block of code that defines a procedure, executed only when called. |
| Immutable          | Objects that cannot be changed after creation (e.g., int, float, bool, string, tuple). |
| Intersection       | A set operation that returns elements present in both sets. |
| Keys               | The `keys()` method returns a view object of all dictionary keys in insertion order. |
| Lists              | Ordered collections of data items enclosed in square brackets `[]`. |
| Logic operations   | Use of logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` to evaluate Boolean expressions. |
| Mutable            | Objects that can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets). |
| Nesting            | A function defined within another function, also called an "inner function." |
| Ratings in Python  | Numerical or qualitative measures used to indicate quality, performance, or value. |
| Set operations     | Mathematical operations on sets: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference. |
| Sets in Python     | Unordered collections of unique elements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. |
| Syntax             | The rules that define the structure of Python code. |
| Tuples             | Immutable sequences used to store multiple items in a single variable. |
| Type casting       | Converting one data type to another (e.g., `int("5")`). |
| Variables          | Symbolic names used to store and manipulate data of various types. |
| Venn diagram       | A graphical tool using overlapping circles to show relationships between sets. |
| Versatile data     | Data that is adaptable and usable across multiple applications or contexts. |

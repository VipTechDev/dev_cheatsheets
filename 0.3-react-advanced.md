## üß† Advanced React Functionality Cheat Sheet  
Hooks, Form Management, and API Integration

---

### üîÅ useState() ‚Äî Managing Component State
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function SideEffect() {
  const [empId, setEmpId] = useState(100);
  return <p>{empId}</p>;
}
```
‚úÖ Use this to track dynamic values like form inputs, toggles, or counters.

---

### ‚ö° useEffect() ‚Äî Handling Side Effects
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function FetchData() {
  const [foods, setFoods] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.npoint.io/d542b9ad99f501ab3dbf')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setFoods(data))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
  }, []);
}
```
‚úÖ The empty array `[]` ensures this runs only once when the component mounts.

---

### üß© Custom Hooks ‚Äî Reusable Logic

**UseToggle.jsx**
```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function UseToggle(initialValue = false) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  const toggle = () => setValue(!value);
  return [value, toggle];
}

export default UseToggle;
```

**ToggleButton.jsx**
```jsx
import UseToggle from './UseToggle';

function ToggleButton() {
  const [isToggled, toggle] = UseToggle(false);
  return <button onClick={toggle}>{isToggled ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}</button>;
}
```
‚úÖ Great for toggles, modals, or any binary state.

---

### üåê Fetch API ‚Äî Basic Data Retrieval
```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
‚úÖ Simple and built-in, but lacks advanced features like interceptors.

---

### üöÄ Axios ‚Äî Enhanced API Requests
```js
import axios from 'axios';

axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then(res => console.log(res.data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
‚úÖ Supports request cancellation, interceptors, and automatic JSON parsing.

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è onChange ‚Äî Tracking Input Changes
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function FormData() {
  const [empName, setEmpName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => setEmpName(e.target.value);
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form submitted:', empName);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={empName} onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
‚úÖ Essential for controlled components and form validation.

---

### üß∞ Redux Toolkit ‚Äî Simplified State Management
```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```
‚úÖ Includes built-in reducers, dev tools integration, and async logic via `createAsyncThunk`.

| Reducers in Redux        | Pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return the new state.                                                              |
| Redux                    | A state management library that centralizes application state and enables predictable updates via actions and reducers.                          |

| Slice                    | A modular section of Redux state defined using `createSlice()`, including its own reducer and actions.                                            |
| Store in RTK             | The complete Redux state tree composed of multiple slices, managed via `configureStore()`.                                                        |

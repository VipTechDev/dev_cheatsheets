## 🧠 Python Cheat Sheet: APIs, HTTP, and Data Collection

This cheat sheet covers how APIs work, how to use HTTP methods in Python, and how to collect and parse data from files and websites.

---

### 🎯 Key Concepts

- **API (Application Programming Interface)** → lets two programs communicate  
- **REST API** → uses HTTP to access resources over the web  
- **HTTP** → protocol for transferring data between client and server  
- **Pandas & BeautifulSoup** → tools for parsing and analyzing data

---

### 🔗 API Basics

- APIs simplify access to services, data, and tools  
- Python APIs often use libraries like `requests`, `randomuser`, or `pandas`  
- Example:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
data = response.json()
```

---

### 📡 HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `GET`    | Retrieve data |
| `POST`   | Submit new data |
| `PUT`    | Update existing data |
| `DELETE` | Remove data |

- HTTP messages often include **JSON** payloads  
- Responses contain metadata like resource type, length, and version

---

### 🌍 URLs and Query Strings

- A **URL** has three parts:  
  - Scheme → `https://`  
  - Base → `example.com`  
  - Route → `/data?id=123`

- You can modify queries using parameters:
```python
url = "https://api.example.com/data?name=apple&id=123"
```

---

### 🧪 Using Requests in Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

---

### 📊 Working with Pandas

- Create a DataFrame from a dictionary:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {"name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "score": [90, 85]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

- Common methods:
```python
df.head()     # First 5 rows
df.mean()     # Column averages
df.describe() # Summary stats
```

- Time series:
```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
```

---

### 📈 Plotly Candlestick Example

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(
    x=df.index,
    open=df['open'],
    high=df['high'],
    low=df['low'],
    close=df['close']
)])
fig.show()
```

---

### 🕸️ Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = "https://example.com"
html = requests.get(url).text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
```

- Find all anchor tags:
```python
links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    print(link.text)
```

- HTML is structured like a tree:
  - Tags = nodes  
  - Children = nested tags  
  - Siblings = tags inside the same parent

---

### 📊 Extract Tables with Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

tables = pd.read_html("https://example.com")
print(tables[0])
```

---

### 📁 File Formats & Parsing

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.csv` | Comma-separated values |
| `.txt` | Plain text |
| `.json` | JavaScript Object Notation |
| `.xml` | Extensible Markup Language |
| `.xlsx` | Excel spreadsheet |

- File extension tells you how to open and parse the file  
- Example: Read CSV with Pandas
```python
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```

- Parse JSON:
```python
import json
with open("data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

- APIs let you access data and services programmatically  
- HTTP methods define how data is sent and received  
- Pandas and BeautifulSoup help parse and analyze structured data  
- Use `requests` to interact with APIs and web pages  
- Use `read_html`, `read_csv`, and JSON/XML parsers to load external data

## 📘 Glossary: APIs and Data Collection

This glossary defines key terms used in API workflows, web scraping, and data handling in Python. Use it to reinforce concepts and build cue-card rituals for deeper understanding.

---

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

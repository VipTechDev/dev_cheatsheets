## üß† Python Cheat Sheet: Programming Fundamentals

This cheat sheet covers essential Python syntax and logic ‚Äî from loops and conditions to functions and exceptions ‚Äî with clear examples to ritualize your mastery.

---

### üîó Logical Operators

#### ‚úÖ AND
Returns `True` if both conditions are true.
```python
marks = 90
attendance_percentage = 87
if marks >= 80 and attendance_percentage >= 85:
    print("Qualify for honors")
else:
    print("Not qualified for honors")
```

#### ‚úÖ OR
Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.
```python
grade = 12
if grade == 11 or grade == 12:
    print("Farewell Party Invitation")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

#### ‚úÖ NOT
Reverses the Boolean value.
```python
isLocked = False
print(not isLocked)  # Output: True
```

### üßÆ Comparison Operators

#### Equal (`==`)
```python
5 == 5        # True
age = 25
age == 30     # False
```

#### Not Equal (`!=`)
```python
a = 10
b = 20
a != b        # True

count = 0
count != 0    # False
```

#### Greater Than (`>`)
```python
9 > 6         # True
age = 20
max_age = 25
age > max_age # False
```

#### Greater Than or Equal (`>=`)
```python
5 >= 5 and 9 >= 5  # True
quantity = 105
minimum = 100
quantity >= minimum  # True
```

#### Less Than (`<`)
```python
4 < 6         # True
score = 60
passing_score = 65
score < passing_score  # True
```

#### Less Than or Equal (`<=`)
```python
5 <= 5 and 3 <= 5  # True
size = 38
max_size = 40
size <= max_size   # True
```

### üîÅ Loops

#### üîÑ For Loop
```python
for num in range(1, 10):
    print(num)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

#### üîÑ While Loop
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

#### ‚õî Loop Controls
```python
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)

for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
```

---

### üß± Functions

#### üîπ Define Function
```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
```

#### üîπ Call Function
```python
greet("Alice")
```

#### üîπ Return Statement
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
```

---

### üß¨ Classes & Objects

#### üîπ Class Definition
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

#### üîπ Object Creation
```python
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
```

---

### üåø Conditional Logic

#### üîπ If Statement
```python
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day!")
```

#### üîπ If-Else Statement
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult.")
else:
    print("You're not an adult yet.")
```

#### üîπ If-Elif-Else
```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("You got an A!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("You got a B.")
else:
    print("You need to work harder.")
```

---

### üî¢ range()
```python
range(5)         # 0 to 4
range(2, 10)     # 2 to 9
range(1, 11, 2)  # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Exception Handling

#### üîπ Try-Except Block
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input.")
```

#### üîπ Try-Except-Else
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input.")
else:
    print("You entered:", num)
```

#### üîπ Try-Except-Finally
```python
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
finally:
    file.close()
```

## üìò Glossary: Python Programming Fundamentals

This glossary defines key terms used throughout Python programming. Use it to reinforce concepts and build cue-card rituals for deeper understanding.

---

| Term                  | Definition |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Analogy               | A concept or comparison outside programming used to explain ideas more clearly. |
| Attributes            | Characteristics or properties of an object, accessed using dot notation. |
| Branching             | Changing the flow of a program using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. |
| Comparison operators  | Operators that compare values and return `True` or `False` (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`). |
| Conditions            | Expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`, used to control program flow. |
| Enumerate             | A built-in function that adds a counter to an iterable during looping. |
| Exception handling    | Managing errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. |
| Explicitly            | Performing actions in a clear and direct way. |
| For loops             | Used to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, or strings. |
| Global variable       | A variable defined outside any function, accessible throughout the program. |
| Incremented           | Increasing a variable‚Äôs value, often using `+=`. |
| Indent                | Whitespace used to define code blocks and structure in Python. |
| Indices               | Positions of elements in a sequence, starting at 0. |
| Iterate               | Repeating actions over items in a collection using loops. |
| Local variables       | Variables defined inside a function, accessible only within that function. |
| Logic operators       | Operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` used to combine Boolean conditions. |
| Loops                 | Structures that repeat code blocks (`for` and `while` loops). |
| Parameters            | Placeholders in function definitions for accepting input values. |
| Programming Fundamentals | Core concepts like variables, control flow, functions, and error handling. |
| Range function        | Generates a sequence of numbers for looping (`range(start, stop, step)`). |
| Scope of function     | The area where a variable is visible and usable, typically inside its function. |
| Sequences             | Ordered collections like strings, lists, and tuples that support indexing. |
| Syntax                | The rules for writing valid Python code, including indentation and punctuation. |
| While loops           | Loops that run as long as a condition remains `True`. |

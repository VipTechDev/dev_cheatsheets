## 🧠 Python Cheat Sheet: Matrix Mathematics with NumPy

This cheat sheet covers how NumPy handles mathematical operations on vectors and matrices — with clear examples and rules for dot products and scalar operations.

### 📦 Importing NumPy

```python
import numpy as np
```

---

### 📏 1D Arrays: Vectors

A **1D array** is called a **vector**.  
- Row vector → horizontal  
- Column vector → vertical

#### 🔹 Create Vectors
```python
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
```

#### ➕ Vector Addition
```python
result = v1 + v2  # [5, 7, 9]
```

#### ➖ Vector Subtraction
```python
result = v1 - v2  # [-3, -3, -3]
```

#### ✖️ Element-wise Multiplication
```python
result = v1 * v2  # [4, 10, 18]
```

---

### 🔢 Scalar Operations on Vectors

You can add, subtract, or multiply a constant (scalar) to every element.

```python
v = np.array([10, 20, 30])

v + 5     # [15, 25, 35]
v - 10    # [0, 10, 20]
v * 2     # [20, 40, 60]
```

---

### 🧮 2D Arrays: Matrices

A **2D array** is called a **matrix**.  
It has rows and columns and supports all vector operations.

#### 🔹 Create Matrices
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
```

#### ➕ Matrix Addition
```python
A + B  # [[6, 8], [10, 12]]
```

#### ✖️ Element-wise Multiplication
```python
A * B  # [[5, 12], [21, 32]]
```

---

### 🔗 Dot Product Rules

The **dot product** multiplies rows of the first matrix with columns of the second.

#### 🔹 Syntax
```python
np.dot(A, B)
```

#### 🔸 Shape Rule
If `A` is shape `(m x n)` and `B` is shape `(n x p)`,  
then `np.dot(A, B)` will be shape `(m x p)`.

#### 🧠 Example 1: 4x2 × 2x4 → 4x4
```python
A = np.random.randint(1, 10, (4, 2))
B = np.random.randint(1, 10, (2, 4))
result = np.dot(A, B)
print(result.shape)  # (4, 4)
```

#### 🧠 Example 2: 2x4 × 4x2 → 2x2
```python
A = np.random.randint(1, 10, (2, 4))
B = np.random.randint(1, 10, (4, 2))
result = np.dot(A, B)
print(result.shape)  # (2, 2)
```

### 🔍 Dot Product of Vectors

#### Row Vector × Column Vector → Scalar
```python
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
np.dot(v1, v2)  # Output: scalar value
```

#### Column Vector × Row Vector → Matrix
```python
v1 = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
np.dot(v1, v2)  # Output: 3x3 matrix
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

- Vectors = 1D arrays  
- Matrices = 2D arrays  
- Operations like `+`, `-`, `*` work element-wise  
- Dot product follows shape rules: `(m x n) × (n x p) → (m x p)`  
- Scalar operations apply to every element  
- Use `np.dot()` for matrix multiplication

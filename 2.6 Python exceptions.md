## üß† Python Cheat Sheet: Exception Handling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Are Exceptions?

Exceptions are alerts that something unexpected happened during program execution.  
They can be triggered automatically or manually using `raise`.  
Handled properly, exceptions prevent your program from crashing.

### üÜö Errors vs Exceptions

| Aspect        | Errors                                                | Exceptions                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Origin        | Caused by system, hardware, or environment             | Caused by issues in your code                               |
| Nature        | Severe, often crashes the program                      | Milder, can be handled gracefully                           |
| Handling      | Usually not handled by the program                     | Can be caught using `try-except` blocks                     |
| Examples      | `SyntaxError`, `NameError`                             | `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`                    |
| Categorized   | Not categorized                                        | Categorized into classes like `IOError`, `ValueError`, etc. |

### üß© Common Python Exceptions

#### ‚ûó ZeroDivisionError
Occurs when dividing by zero.
```python
result = 10 / 0  # Raises ZeroDivisionError
```

---

#### üî¢ ValueError
Occurs when using an invalid value.
```python
num = int("abc")  # Raises ValueError
```

---

#### üìÇ FileNotFoundError
Occurs when trying to open a file that doesn‚Äôt exist.
```python
with open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()  # Raises FileNotFoundError
```

---

#### üì¶ IndexError
Occurs when accessing a list index that‚Äôs out of range.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
value = my_list[1]      # OK
missing = my_list[5]    # Raises IndexError
```

---

#### üîë KeyError
Occurs when accessing a missing key in a dictionary.
```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
value = my_dict.get("city")     # OK, returns None
missing = my_dict["city"]       # Raises KeyError
```

---

#### üî§ TypeError
Occurs when using incompatible types.
```python
result = "hello" + 5  # Raises TypeError
```

---

#### üß¨ AttributeError
Occurs when accessing a method or attribute that doesn‚Äôt exist.
```python
text = "example"
length = len(text)           # OK
missing = text.some_method() # Raises AttributeError
```

---

#### üì¶ ImportError
Occurs when importing a module that doesn‚Äôt exist.
```python
import non_existent_module  # Raises ImportError
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Handling Exceptions with try-except

Use `try` to wrap risky code, and `except` to handle errors gracefully.

#### Example: Handling Division by Zero
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")

print("outside of try and except block")
```

- ‚úÖ Code inside `try` is attempted  
- ‚ùå If an exception occurs, `except` runs instead  
- üß≠ Program continues after the block

---

### üß† Summary

- Exceptions help you manage unexpected issues  
- Use `try-except` to keep your program running smoothly  
- Know common exceptions so you can handle them proactively  
- Python gives you the tools ‚Äî your job is to use them wisely

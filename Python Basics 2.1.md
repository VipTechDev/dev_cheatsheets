## 🧠 Python Basics Cheat Sheet  
Comments, Concatenation, Data Types, Indexing, String Methods, Operators, and Variable Assignment

---

### 💬 Comments  
```python
# This is a comment
```  
✅ Use comments to explain logic or disable code temporarily.

---

### 🔗 Concatenation  
```python
concatenated_string = string1 + string2  
result = "Hello" + " John"
```  
✅ Combine strings using the `+` operator.

---

### 🔢 Data Types  
```python
x = 7           # Integer  
y = 12.4        # Float  
is_valid = True # Boolean  
is_valid = False  
F_Name = "John" # String
```  
✅ Python supports multiple data types for flexible logic.

---

### 🔍 Indexing  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
char = my_string[0]
```  
✅ Access characters by position using square brackets.

---

### 📏 len()  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
length = len(my_string)
```  
✅ Use `len()` to get the number of characters in a string.

---

### 🔡 lower()  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
lowercase_text = my_string.lower()
```  
✅ Convert strings to lowercase for normalization.

---

### 🖨️ print()  
```python
print("Hello, world")  
print(a + b)
```  
✅ Display output or debug values with `print()`.

---

### ➕ Python Operators  
```python
x = 9  
y = 4  
result_add = x + y    # Addition  
result_sub = x - y    # Subtraction  
result_mul = x * y    # Multiplication  
result_div = x / y    # Division  
result_fdiv = x // y  # Floor Division  
result_mod = x % y    # Modulo
```  
✅ Perform arithmetic with built-in operators.

---

### 🔁 replace()  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
new_text = my_string.replace("Hello", "Hi")
```  
✅ Replace substrings using `replace()`.

---

### ✂️ Slicing  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
substring = my_string[0:5]
```  
✅ Extract parts of strings using `[start:end]`.

---

### 🔪 split()  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
split_text = my_string.split(",")
```  
✅ Break strings into lists using a delimiter.

---

### 🧼 strip()  
```python
my_string = " Hello "  
trimmed = my_string.strip()
```  
✅ Remove leading/trailing whitespace.

---

### 🔠 upper()  
```python
my_string = "Hello"  
uppercase_text = my_string.upper()
```  
✅ Convert strings to uppercase.

---

### 📥 Variable Assignment  
```python
name = "John"  # Assigning string to variable  
x = 5          # Assigning integer to variable
```  
✅ Store values in variables for reuse and clarity.

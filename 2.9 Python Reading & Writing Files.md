## 🧠 Python Cheat Sheet: Reading Plain Text Files

This cheat sheet covers how to open, read, and process plain text files in Python — using best practices and clear examples.

---

### 📂 What Are Plain Text Files?

Plain text files contain unformatted text.  
You can read them all at once or line by line.

---

### 🔓 Opening Files

#### 🔹 Method 1: Using `open()`
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')  # Opens file in read mode
```
- `'r'` → read  
- `'w'` → write  
- `'a'` → append

#### 🔸 Method 2: Using `with` (Recommended)
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Your code here
```
- Automatically closes the file  
- Cleaner and safer

---

### ✅ Why Use `with`?

- Automatically closes the file  
- Prevents resource leaks  
- No need to call `file.close()` manually

---

### 📖 Reading Entire File

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_stuff = file.read()
    print(file_stuff)
```

- `file.read()` reads all content as a string  
- Store it in a variable for processing  
- File closes automatically after the block

---

### 📄 Reading Line by Line

#### 🔹 Using `readline()`
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
line1 = file.readline()
line2 = file.readline()

print(line1)
if 'important' in line2:
    print("This line is important!")
file.close()
```

#### 🔸 Using a Loop
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
while True:
    line = file.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    print(line)
file.close()
```

- Reads one line at a time  
- Use `break` when no lines are left  
- Always close the file when done

---

### 🔠 Reading Specific Characters

#### 🔹 Open the File
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
```

#### 🔸 Move to a Specific Position
```python
file.seek(10)  # Move to byte 11
```

#### 🔹 Read Characters
```python
characters = file.read(5)  # Read next 5 characters
print(characters)
```

#### 🔸 Close the File
```python
file.close()
```

- `seek()` moves the file pointer  
- `read(n)` reads `n` characters from current position  
- Always close the file to free resources

---

### 🧠 Summary

- Use `open()` or `with open()` to access files  
- `read()` → entire content  
- `readline()` → one line  
- `read(n)` → specific characters  
- `seek()` → move to a position  
- Always close files unless using `with`

## 🧠 Python Cheat Sheet: Reading & Writing Text Files

This cheat sheet covers how to open, read, write, append, and copy plain text files in Python — using best practices and clear examples.

---

### 📂 What Are Plain Text Files?

Plain text files contain unformatted text.  
You can read them all at once, line by line, or write new content into them.

---

### 🔓 Opening Files

#### 🔹 Method 1: Using `open()`
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')  # Opens file in read mode
```

#### 🔸 Method 2: Using `with` (Recommended)
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Your code here
```

- Automatically closes the file  
- Prevents resource leaks  
- No need to call `file.close()` manually

---

### 📖 Reading Entire File

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_stuff = file.read()
    print(file_stuff)
```

- `file.read()` reads all content as a string  
- Store it in a variable for processing  
- File closes automatically after the block

---

### 📄 Reading Line by Line

#### 🔹 Using `readline()`
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
line1 = file.readline()
line2 = file.readline()

print(line1)
if 'important' in line2:
    print("This line is important!")
file.close()
```

#### 🔸 Using a Loop
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
while True:
    line = file.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    print(line)
file.close()
```

---

### 🔠 Reading Specific Characters

```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
file.seek(10)               # Move to byte 11
characters = file.read(5)   # Read next 5 characters
print(characters)
file.close()
```

- `seek()` moves the file pointer  
- `read(n)` reads `n` characters from current position

---

### ✍️ Writing to a File

```python
with open('Example2.txt', 'w') as file1:
    file1.write("This is line A\n")
    file1.write("This is line B\n")
```

- `'w'` mode creates or overwrites the file  
- `write()` adds content  
- `\n` starts a new line

---

### 📋 Writing Multiple Lines with a List

```python
Lines = ["This is line 1", "This is line 2", "This is line 3"]
with open('Example3.txt', 'w') as file2:
    for line in Lines:
        file2.write(line + "\n")
```

- Loop through list  
- Write each line with newline character

---

### ➕ Appending to an Existing File

```python
new_data = "This is line C"
with open('Example2.txt', 'a') as file1:
    file1.write(new_data + "\n")
```

- `'a'` mode adds to the end of the file  
- Doesn’t erase existing content

---

### 📤 Copying Contents from One File to Another

```python
with open('source.txt', 'r') as source_file:
    with open('destination.txt', 'w') as destination_file:
        for line in source_file:
            destination_file.write(line)
```

- Read from source  
- Write each line to destination  
- Both files close automatically

---

### 🧾 File Modes in Python

| Mode   | Syntax | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Read   | `'r'`  | Opens file for reading. Error if file doesn’t exist. |
| Write  | `'w'`  | Creates new file or overwrites existing one. |
| Append | `'a'`  | Adds data to end of file. Creates file if missing. |
| Create | `'x'`  | Creates new file. Error if file exists. |
| Binary Read   | `'rb'` | Reads binary file. |
| Binary Write  | `'wb'` | Writes binary file. |
| Binary Append | `'ab'` | Appends to binary file. |
| Binary Create | `'xb'` | Creates binary file. Error if exists. |
| Text Read     | `'rt'` | Reads text file. Default mode. |
| Text Write    | `'wt'` | Writes text file. Default mode. |
| Text Append   | `'at'` | Appends to text file. Default mode. |
| Text Create   | `'xt'` | Creates text file. Error if exists. |
| Read+Write    | `'r+'` | Opens file for reading and writing. |
| Write+Read    | `'w+'` | Creates file for reading and writing. Overwrites if exists. |
| Append+Read   | `'a+'` | Opens file for appending and reading. Creates if missing. |
| Create+Read+Write | `'x+'` | Creates file for reading and writing. Error if exists. |

- `read(n)` → specific characters  
- `write()` → add content

## 🧠 Python Cheat Sheet: Classes & Objects

This cheat sheet covers how to define classes, create objects, and interact with attributes and methods — with real-world examples to help you ritualize the logic.

---

### 🏗️ 1. What Is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.  
Think of it like a cookie cutter — the class defines the shape, and each object is a cookie made from it.

```python
class Car:
    pass  # Empty class for now
```

---

### 🚗 2. What Is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class.  
It has:
- **State** → stored in attributes (e.g., color, speed)
- **Behavior** → defined by methods (e.g., accelerate)

---

### 🧱 3. Class Structure

#### 🔹 Class Declaration
```python
class ClassName:
    pass
```

#### 🔸 Class Attribute (shared by all objects)
```python
class ClassName:
    class_attribute = "shared value"
```

#### 🔧 Constructor Method (`__init__`)
Initializes object-specific data.
```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
        self.attribute1 = attribute1
        self.attribute2 = attribute2
```

#### 🔹 Instance Methods
Functions that operate on object data.
```python
class ClassName:
    def method1(self, param1, param2):
        # Do something with self.attribute1
        pass

    def method2(self, param1):
        pass
```

---

### 🧪 4. Creating Objects

```python
object1 = ClassName("value1", "value2")
object2 = ClassName("value3", "value4")
```

---

### 🧬 5. Interacting with Objects

#### 🔹 Call Methods (Dot Notation)
```python
result1 = object1.method1("param1", "param2")
result2 = object2.method2("paramX")
```

#### 🔸 Assign Method to Variable
```python
method_ref = object1.method1
result3 = method_ref("param1", "param2")
```

#### 📥 Access Attributes
```python
value = object1.attribute1
```

#### ✏️ Modify Attributes
```python
object1.attribute2 = "new value"
```

#### 🏷️ Access Class Attribute
```python
shared_value = ClassName.class_attribute
```

---

### 🚘 6. Real-World Example: Car Class

```python
class Car:
    max_speed = 120  # Class attribute shared by all cars

    def __init__(self, make, model, color, speed=0):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.speed = speed

    def accelerate(self, acceleration):
        if self.speed + acceleration <= Car.max_speed:
            self.speed += acceleration
        else:
            self.speed = Car.max_speed

    def get_speed(self):
        return self.speed
```

---

### 🏎️ 7. Using the Car Class

#### 🔹 Create Car Objects
```python
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "Blue")
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", "Red")
```

#### 🔸 Accelerate Cars
```python
car1.accelerate(30)
car2.accelerate(20)
```

#### 📊 Display Speeds
```python
print(f"{car1.make} {car1.model} is currently at {car1.get_speed()} km/h.")
print(f"{car2.make} {car2.model} is currently at {car2.get_speed()} km/h.")
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

- Classes define structure and behavior  
- Objects are instances with their own data  
- Use `self` to access attributes and methods  
- Dot notation lets you interact with objects  
- Class attributes are shared; instance attributes are unique

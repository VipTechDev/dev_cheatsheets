## ðŸ§  Python Cheat Sheet: Reading Plain Text Files

This cheat sheet covers how to open, read, and process plain text files in Python â€” using best practices and clear examples.

---

### ðŸ“‚ What Are Plain Text Files?

Plain text files contain unformatted text.  
You can read them all at once or line by line.

---

### ðŸ”“ Opening Files

#### ðŸ”¹ Method 1: Using `open()`
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')  # Opens file in read mode
```
- `'r'` â†’ read  
- `'w'` â†’ write  
- `'a'` â†’ append

#### ðŸ”¸ Method 2: Using `with` (Recommended)
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Your code here
```
- Automatically closes the file  
- Cleaner and safer

---

### âœ… Why Use `with`?

- Automatically closes the file  
- Prevents resource leaks  
- No need to call `file.close()` manually

---

### ðŸ“– Reading Entire File

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_stuff = file.read()
    print(file_stuff)
```

- `file.read()` reads all content as a string  
- Store it in a variable for processing  
- File closes automatically after the block

---

### ðŸ“„ Reading Line by Line

#### ðŸ”¹ Using `readline()`
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
line1 = file.readline()
line2 = file.readline()

print(line1)
if 'important' in line2:
    print("This line is important!")
file.close()
```

#### ðŸ”¸ Using a Loop
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
while True:
    line = file.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    print(line)
file.close()
```

- Reads one line at a time  
- Use `break` when no lines are left  
- Always close the file when done

---

### ðŸ”  Reading Specific Characters

#### ðŸ”¹ Open the File
```python
file = open('file.txt', 'r')
```

#### ðŸ”¸ Move to a Specific Position
```python
file.seek(10)  # Move to byte 11
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Read Characters
```python
characters = file.read(5)  # Read next 5 characters
print(characters)
```

#### ðŸ”¸ Close the File
```python
file.close()
```

- `seek()` moves the file pointer  
- `read(n)` reads `n` characters from current position  
- Always close the file to free resources

---

### ðŸ§  Summary

- Use `open()` or `with open()` to access files  
- `read()` â†’ entire content  
- `readline()` â†’ one line  
- `read(n)` â†’ specific characters  
- `seek()` â†’ move to a position  
- Always close files unless using `with`
